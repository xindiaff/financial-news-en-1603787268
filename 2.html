The decline was even more marked in the four months to August, at 21.5%, with both domestic sales and exports hit, industry association Chocosuisse said in a statement on Tuesday. Over 70% of Swiss chocolate is exported, with business particularly affected this summer by the downturn in travel and tourism, said the association, which counts Barry Callebaut BARN.S and Lindt &amp; Spruengli LISN.S among its members.</p> World Reuters <h3> No trick or treating: Halloween is cancelled for England&#x27;s high risk areas </h3> <p> Trick or treating during Halloween is banned in the areas of England in the highest level of COVID-19 lockdown, a junior minister in Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s government said on Tuesday.

Yet the positive surprise may do little to change the gloomy outlook for Big Oil amid the coronavirus pandemic.While crude prices have recovered from historic lows seen in April, BP’s profit was down 96% from a year earlier as restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the U.S. kept fuel demand at bay. The company warned of a “volatile and challenging trading environment” where “the shape and pace of the recovery is uncertain.”BP reported an adjusted net income of $86 million for the third quarter on Tuesday, down from $2.25 billion a year earlier. That’s an improvement from the second quarter, when the company posted a $6.68 billion loss. Shares rose 1.9% to 203.8 pence at 8:07 a.m. in London.“Having set out our new strategy in detail, our priority is execution,” Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in a statement. “Despite a challenging environment, we are doing just that.”Weaker TradingOne positive sign for BP was a drop in net debt to $40.4 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $46.5 billion a year earlier. After cutting the dividend in August, reducing debt is necessary to give investors confidence that the payout is now sustainable.“Funding the dividend remains our first priority and we are confident in moving toward our $35 billion net-debt target,” Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss said in the statement.BP’s trading division, which last quarter brought in “exceptionally strong results,” wasn’t able to cushion the blow this time around. With a less volatile market and fewer opportunities for so-called contango plays -- a trade that profits from buying and storing oil during a glut -- the unit’s earnings were “significantly lower,” the company said.Other oil majors, who report later this week, have already told investors they experienced the same headwinds as BP. “Refining margins are absolutely terrible,” Patrick Pouyanne, Total SE’s chief executive officer, said earlier this month. Royal Dutch Shell Plc warned that its trading performance will be “below average” in the third quarter.Despite BP’s better-than-expected third-quarter performance, some of those other companies still offer a better balance of risk and reward for investors, RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. Shell in particular has a core business that generates more cash and a dividend that should grow over time, he said.(Updates with share price in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p> <h3> <span> JPMorgan Sees S&amp;P at 3,900 If Trump Wins Election: Taking Stock</span> </h3> Bloomberg <span> </span> <h3> <span> Walmart CEO gives his outlook for retail</span> </h3> Yahoo Finance Video <h3> <span> Former Trump advisor Gary Cohn: Markets are down on the &#x27;100% probability&#x27; that stimulus deal won&#x27;t pass before the election</span> </h3> Yahoo Finance <span> Advertise With Us</span> <span> <span> © 2020 Verizon Media.
